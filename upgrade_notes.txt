# Upgrade 4.4.4 -> 5.0.4

Alpine doesn't package rt5, so the Dockerfiles were updates to install all dependencies and "build" rt5 from scratch.

Upgrading from 4.4.4 -> 5.0.4 has some sort of circular dependency issue where trying to upgrade the database schema fails because a field (CustomRoles.LookupType) doesn't exist. It's not added to the schema until 5.0.4, but one of the libs used during the database upgrade expects it to be there.

To work around this, run the following SQL to add the field prematurely:

    ALTER TABLE CustomRoles ADD COLUMN LookupType varchar(255) CHARACTER SET ascii;
    UPDATE CustomRoles SET LookupType='RT::Queue-RT::Ticket';

Then upgrade the database to 5.0.3, drop the field, and finish the upgrade to 5.0.4.

After the database is upgraded, a cleanup script needs to be run:

    PERL5LIB=/opt/rt5/lib /fileenv /opt/rt5/etc/upgrade/shrink-cgm-table

# Upgrade 4.0.4 -> 4.4.2

These are notes on upgrading an old instance of RT (4.0.4) to the 4.4.2. This includes adding full-text index and full UTF-8 support (utf8mb4.)

Scripts are included for sending SMS through Twilio.

change utf8 to utf8mb4
    $ sed -i "s/SET NAMES utf8 /SET NAMES utf8mb4 /g" rtdb.sql
    $ sed -i "s/SET character_set_client = utf8 /SET character_set_client = utf8mb4 /g" rtdb.sql
    $ sed -i "s/DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;/DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4;/g" rtdb.sql
import database
null field in users table:
    SQL: update Users set ExternalAuthId=NULL;
add timezones to database:
    $ apk add --no-cache mysql mysql-client
    $ mysql_tzinfo_to_sql /usr/share/zoneinfo | mysql -h db -P 3306 -u root -p mysql
restart db
run database upgrade:
    # comment fulltext index config section
    $ /fileenv rt-setup-database --action upgrade --datadir /etc/rt4/upgrade
set up full text indexing:
    $ /fileenv /usr/sbin/rt-setup-fulltext-index --dba-password <password>
    # uncomment fulltext index config section
Change fulltext tables to utf8mb4
    SQL: ALTER TABLE AttachmentsIndex CONVERT TO CHARACTER SET utf8mb4;
Finish fulltext indexing
    $ /fileenv rt-fulltext-indexer
restart db and rt4

Set theme CSS

Create new Custom Role:
    Role Name: Queue Manager
    Description: Receives notifications about new Tickets in a Queue

Replace Scripts:
    On Create Notify Queue Managers by SMS: notify_managers.pm
    On Owner Change Notify Owner By SMS: notify_owner_change.pm
    Put "return 1;" in "Custom action preparation code"
    Put script body in "Custom action commit code"
